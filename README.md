Mixpanel PHP Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mixpanel/mixpanel-php.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mixpanel/mixpanel-php)
============
This library provides an API to track events and update profiles on Mixpanel.

Install with Composer
------------
Add mixpanel/mixpanel-php as a dependency and run composer update

```json
"require": {
    ...
    "mixpanel/mixpanel-php" : "2.*"
    ...
}
```

Now you can start tracking events and people:

```php
<?php
// import dependencies
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// get the Mixpanel class instance, replace with your project token
$mp = Mixpanel::getInstance("MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN");

// track an event
$mp->track("button clicked", array("label" => "sign-up")); 

// create/update a profile for user id 12345
$mp->people->set(12345, array(
    '$first_name'       => "John",
    '$last_name'        => "Doe",
    '$email'            => "john.doe@example.com",
    '$phone'            => "5555555555",
    "Favorite Color"    => "red"
));
```


Install Manually
------------
 1. <a href="https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-php/archive/master.zip">Download the Mixpanel PHP Library</a>
 2.  Extract the zip file to a directory called "mixpanel-php" in your project root
 3.  Now you can start tracking events and people:

```php
<?php
// import Mixpanel
require 'mixpanel-php/lib/autoload.php';

// get the Mixpanel class instance, replace with your project token
$mp = Mixpanel::getInstance("MIXPANEL_PROJECT_TOKEN");

// track an event
$mp->track("button clicked", array("label" => "sign-up"));

// create/update a profile for user id 12345
$mp->people->set(12345, array(
    '$first_name'       => "John",
    '$last_name'        => "Doe",
    '$email'            => "john.doe@example.com",
    '$phone'            => "5555555555",
    "Favorite Color"    => "red"
));
```

Production Notes
-------------
By default, data is sent using ssl over cURL. This works fine when you're tracking a small number of events or aren't concerned with the potentially blocking nature of the PHP cURL calls. However, this isn't very efficient when you're sending hundreds of events (such as in batch processing). Our library comes packaged with an easy way to use a persistent socket connection for much more efficient writes. To enable the persistent socket, simply pass `'consumer' => 'socket'` as an entry in the `$options` array when you instantiate the Mixpanel class. Additionally, you can contribute your own persistence implementation by creating a custom Consumer.

Changelog
-------------
Version 2.6.2:
 * Added support for $ignore_time
 * Cleaned up some comments to be more clear

Version 2.6.1:
 * Fixed bug in SocketConsumer timeout

Version 2.6:
 * Updated default for `connect_timeout` in SocketConsumer to be 5

Version 2.5:
 * `timeout` option now refers to `CURLOPT_TIMEOUT` instead of `CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT` in non-forked cURL calls, it has been removed from the SocketConsumer in favor of a new `connect_timeout` option.
 * Added a new `connect_timeout` option for CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT in non-forked cURL calls (CurlConsumer) and the socket timeout (SocketConsumer)
 * Set default timeout (CURLOPT_TIMEOUT) to 30 seconds in non-forked cURL calls
 * Set default connection timeoute (CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT) to 5 seconds in non-forked cURL calls
 * We now pass cURL errors from non-forked cURL calls to `_handle_error` with the curl errno and message


Version 2.4:
 * Fixed a bug where passing the integer 0 for the `ip` parameter would be ignored

Version 2.1 - 2.3:
 * Broken releases

Version 2.0:
 * Changed the default consumer to be 'curl' (CurlConsumer)
 * Changed the default setting of 'fork' to false in the Curl Consumer. This means that by default, events and profile updates are sent synchronously using the PHP cURL lib when using the Curl Consumer.
 * 'createAlias' uses the CurlConsumer with 'fork' explicitly set to false (as we need this to be synchronous) instead of the SocketConsumer. 
 * Fixed bug where max_queue_size was never read
